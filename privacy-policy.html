						</p>
						<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
						<p>
							Like most website operators, Wordlegame.org collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Wordlegame.org's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Wordlegame.org's visitors use its website. From time to time, Wordlegame.org may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
							<br>
							Wordlegame.org also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a href="https://wordlegame.org/">https://wordlegame.org/</a> blog posts. Wordlegame.org only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.
						</p>
						<h3>Security</h3>
						<p>
							The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
						</p>
						<h3>Advertisements</h3>
						<p>
							Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Wordlegame.org and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
						</p>
						<h3>Links To External Sites</h3>

Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on someone's past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google's privacy policy.
